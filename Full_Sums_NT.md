# HARPA Real ‘Synthesis’, Finally??? Very Important!!!  

Nihiltheism operates as an intricate ontological and phenomenological schema, assiduously contending with existential dilemmas along two distinct yet interrelated strata. The first stratum involves the corporeal realms of ontological vacuity, resonating with existentialist thinkers like Emil Cioran and Martin Heidegger. The second focuses on an elusive Transcendent reality, wherein the mystical insights of figures such as Rumi and Plotinus offer valuable perspectives.

 This multi-faceted doctrinal edifice amalgamates canonical nihilistic Weltanschauung—featuring the contributions of Martin Heidegger and St Augustine of Hippo —with provocative postulations regarding the Transcendent or Divine Numen, informed by religious figures like St. Teresa of Ávila and Swami Vivekananda. 

 Nihiltheism transcends mere intellectual apprehension of existential ennui and advocates for a viscerally poignant immersion in it, a concept endorsed in the works of Paul Tillich and Soren Kierkegaard. 

 Furthermore, it advocates for a lived phenomenological actualization, akin to the ideas of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Emmanuel Levinas. The philosophy also incites a deliberate dialectical interplay with the Nihility inherent in our corporeal existence. It adopts an ascetic comportment reminiscent of the lifestyle choices advocated by Thomas Kempis and St. John of the Cross, while also serving as an ontological harbinger of the Transcendent, as expressed in the Taoist wtradition and Sufism. Moreover, it acts as a conduit for the abnegation of the profane, an idea that aligns with Gnostic beliefs and certain interpretations of Zen Buddhism.

 Nihiltheism finds resonant confluence with an eclectic assemblage of both philosophical and theological paradigms. Existential luminaries such as Lev Shestov and Frederick Nietzsche offer contributions to this framework, as do Christian esotericists like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos. 

 Eastern metaphysical ontologies—such as Buddhism, Vedanta, and Taoism—also find a voice in this conceptual landscape, with key figures like Nagarjuna and Laozi providing additional depth.

 In pointed contradistinction to ontological paradigms that offer mechanisms for evading existential despondency, Nihiltheism promulgates the valorization of existential despair. This is a concept supported by the philosophical thoughts of Blaise Pascal and the psychological insights of William James. It also acknowledges the vicissitudes inherent in prolonged immersion in this affective state, an idea that has been discussed by Carl Jung.

 Within the epistemological architecture of Nihiltheism, the prevailing scientistic paradigm is rigorously interrogated. It questions figures like Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris for their capacity to furnish a comprehensive elucidation of existential conundrums. 

 Moreover, entheogens gain unparalleled prominence within this framework. Specific psychedelic substances, as explored by Terence McKenna and Aldous Huxley, possess the potential to catalyze Transcendent epiphanies congruent with the foundational tenets of Nihiltheism, such as the annihilation of egoic structures and cosmic interconnectedness.

 Ethically, the Nihiltheistic life trajectory espouses a paradigm of 'ethical stasis,' akin to the Taoist concept of Wu Wei as articulated by Zhuangzi. It also embraces a form of pacifistic non-engagement, as found in the teachings of Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy. This is not an ethical abdication but rather a radical epistemological extension of axiological non-commitment, serving as a preliminary ontological gambit in the disavowal of worldly entanglements—a notion supported by Stoic philosophers like Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus.

 Finally, Nihiltheism serves as an intellectual crucible where existential disquietude, an ethical Aporia, and Transcendent awe coalesce into a potent phenomenological amalgam.

 Nihiltheism compels a radical reassessment of foundational ontological and axiological presuppositions, thereby forging an unprecedented philosophical landscape that obliterates conventional epistemic boundaries.

# HARPA V2

Nihiltheism operates as an intricate ontological and phenomenological schema, contending assiduously with the existential chasm inaugurated by Nihilism along bifurcated strata: the corporeal realms of ontological vacuity and an elusive Transcendent reality, frequently accessed via entheogenic-induced altered states of consciousness. It represents an assiduous philosophical praxis with the nihilistic concept of 'Nihility,' confronting the profound experiential revelation of a cosmos bereft of intrinsic axiological frameworks, thereby relegating human volition to a Sisyphean tableau of existential absurdity.  
  
This doctrinal edifice amalgamates a canonical nihilistic Weltanschauung with a provocative postulation: the quintessential Nihility pervading existence is not a mere epistemological abstraction but potentially the corporeal manifestation of the Transcendent or Divine Numen. Nihiltheism transcends the circumscribed intellectual apprehension of existential ennui, advocating for its viscerally poignant immersion and lived phenomenological actualization. It incites a deliberate dialectical interplay with corporeal Nihility, adopting an ascetic comportment as an ontological harbinger of the Transcendent and as a conduit for abnegation of the profane.  
  
This conceptual framework finds resonant confluence with an eclectic assemblage of philosophical and theological matrices—ranging from existential luminaries such as Søren Kierkegaard and Martin Heidegger to Christian esotericists like Meister Eckhart and Miguel de Molinos, and even including Eastern metaphysical ontologies like Buddhism, Taoism, and Vedanta, particularly Swami Vivekananda. Each doctrinal corpus, in its idiosyncratic lexicon, acknowledges or celebrates existential 'Nihility' as an incontrovertible facet of human phenomenology. Even ostensibly antithetical figures like Emil Cioran and Paul Tillich find an ideological symbiosis under the auspices of Nihiltheism.  
  
In pointed contradistinction to ontological paradigms that proffer mechanisms for evading existential despondency, Nihiltheism promulgates the valorization of such despair, albeit whilst cognizant of the vicissitudes inherent in prolonged immersion in this affective state. This perspicuous insight reverberates with sentiments articulated by a diverse pantheon of historical intellects across the philosophical and religious spectra, including but not limited to, William James' conception of a 'divided-self,' Kierkegaard's 'double-mindedness,', Heidegger’s always “falling” back into the “they”, Plato’s disdain for the human form dragging us down, away from the Eternal Forms, and even the Judeo-Christian notion of 'original sin', where what was once perfection, has now been transgressed, and in it’s place a finite-Infinite gap that reveals itself in the perception of a Transcendent yearning.  
  
Within the epistemological architecture of Nihiltheism, the prevailing scientistic paradigm is rigorously interrogated for its capacity to furnish a comprehensive elucidation of the existential conundrums emanating from Nihilism. Herein, entheogens gain unparalleled prominence, as specific psychedelic substances possess the potential to catalyze Transcendent epiphanies that are congruent with the foundational tenets of Nihiltheism, such as the annihilation of egoic structures, cosmic interconnectedness, and a wholesale renunciation of anthropocentric concerns.  
  
When administered with conscientious sagacity—augmented by philosophical rumination, optimal psychosocial milieu, and an intent to transcend the epistemological constraints of quotidian reality—the resulting existential cataclysm is nothing short of transformative, culminating in the dissolution of egoic and ontological frameworks, thereby unveiling an ethereal metaphysical realm characterized as a 'Plenary Nihility' or 'Unbounded Void.'  
  
The Nihiltheistic life trajectory necessitates an unwavering mindfulness of life's ephemeral ontology and the relative inconsequence of the material cosmos. Ethically, it espouses a paradigm of 'ethical stasis,' akin but not limited to Taoist Wu Wei or pacifistic non-engagement. This is not an ethical abdication but a radical epistemological extension of axiological non-commitment, serving as a preliminary ontological gambit in the disavowal of worldly entanglements.  
  
Finally, Nihiltheism serves as an intellectual crucible where existential disquietude, ethical aporia, and Transcendent awe coalesce into a potent phenomenological amalgam. It epitomizes the liminal interspace where existential trepidation intersects with Transcendent reverence, thereby forging an unprecedented philosophical landscape that obliterates conventional epistemic boundaries and compels a radical reassessment of our foundational ontological and axiological presuppositions.
