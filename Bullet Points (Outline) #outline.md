# Bullet Points (Outline) #outline

## Preface

- _Exploration of Nihilism_ : an in-depth interpretation of Nihilism, challenging mainstream philosophical definitions and offering a unique perspective. This is the main theme of the writing, and it is likely to be the primary takeaway for most readers.
- _Use of Quotations_ : I extensively quote from a variety of thinkers to support my arguments to show that my work is well-researched and grounded in existing philosophical thought.  While further, and more importantly, attempting to provide irrefutable proof that the experience of Nihilism, as rare as it may be, is something that has an ontological reality.  
- _Questioning 'Originality'_ : You question the need for authors to always be original and defend their use of other authors' work. This could provoke readers to reconsider their own expectations of originality in philosophical writing.
- _Personal Struggle_ : You share your personal struggle between confidence and humility, as well as your desire for truth and help. This adds a personal, introspective dimension to your work, making it more relatable to readers.
- _Contrasting Tones_ : You mention that your work will include differing tones and may seem as if written by multiple authors. This could intrigue readers and make them curious about the different perspectives and styles in your writing.

## 1\. The Abyssal Experience of Nihilism

- _The exploration of Nihilism_ : The document delves deeply into the concept of Nihilism, its implications, and its experience. It suggests that Nihilism is not just a philosophical concept but a lived experience that can profoundly affect one's worldview.
- _The Challenge of Constructing a Philosophy of Religion Based on Nothingness_: The text asks whether it's possible to build a philosophy of religion based on the Nothing of the world, exploring the demand for such a philosophy and questioning the possibility of interpreting Nihilism as a religious experience. This inquiry delves into the intersection of philosophy, religion, and existential experience, offering a unique angle to the exploration of Nihilism.
- _The Pitfalls of Atheistic and Religious Philosophies_: The writing critiques both atheistic philosophers for their rejection of the transcendent and religious philosophers for their shallow understanding of the divine. It illustrates a failure to recognize the complex nature of the divine, leading to a distortion of the philosophical pursuit.
- _The critique of philosophy and religion_ : The text critically examines the roles and limitations of both philosophy and religion in addressing existential questions, suggesting that both often fail to adequately confront the reality of Nihilism.

- _The emphasis on direct experience_ : The document repeatedly stresses the importance of direct, personal experience, particularly in relation to Nihilism. It suggests that true understanding of Nihilism can only come from personal encounter, not intellectual study or discussion.
- _Dissolution of Subjective and Objective Qualities_: Both subjective justifications and objective, intrinsic qualities of moral values dissolve. This dissolution leaves one adrift, confronting an existential void where all conventional beliefs, values, and identities unravel. The once solid foundation upon which they built their understanding of the world crumbles, leaving them paralyzed in a state of profound uncertainty.
- _Existential Void_: This all-encompassing epiphany, leaves one grappling with the very essence of what it means to be human, as the totality of their being is called into question.
- _Dread-Filled Realization_: The visceral quality of this nightmarish realization, of the absurdity that all human movement, being motivated by values that do not exist, leads to all human decisions/acts as almost comically absurd. It's an overwhelming experience that reduces both the world and oneself to Nothingness.
- _The Dialectic of Transcendent Despair_: This is the realization of the existential horror of self-aware existence, emphasizing the dissolution of both subjective justifications and objective qualities of meaning, values, and purpose.
- _The exploration of Transcendence_ : The document proposes the term 'Transcendence' as a more neutral alternative to 'religious', suggesting that it allows for a broader and less dogmatic exploration of experiences and phenomena that go beyond the purely material or naturalistic.
- _The Experience of Nihilism and the Possibility of Constructive Content_: The text explores the various experiences of Nihilism (e.g., boredom, anxiety, depression) and raises the question of whether there may be a constructive or illusory 'message' within this experience. It calls for an honest inquiry into Nihilism's essence without reducing it to mere arguments or rationalizations.
- _The critique of societal norms and values_ : The text challenges the societal norms and values that distract from or deny the experience of Nihilism, suggesting that they are ultimately illusory and unfulfilling.
- _The question of meaning_ : Throughout the document, the question of meaning - or lack thereof - in human existence is continually raised. The text suggests that confronting Nihilism can lead to a profound crisis of meaning.
- _The role of dread and despair_ : The document highlights the role of emotions such as dread and despair in the experience of Nihilism, suggesting that these emotions can provide a direct encounter with the 'nothingness' at the heart of existence.
- _The Hidden Meaninglessness and the Ontological Basis of Nihilism_: This part emphasizes the hidden meaninglessness in worldly activities and the need to understand the ontological foundation of Nothingness. It poses an existential question about the worth of what we hold most meaningful, probing the depths of existential terror.
- _The Nature of Existence, Denial of Nihilism, and the Illusion of Security_: The writing explores the denial of Nihilism, the fleeting nature of human existence, and the illusions that mask the underlying dread and horror. It captures a world of ignorance and false security, contrasting it with the stark reality of inevitable oblivion.
- _Nihilism as the Teacher_: Insights and ideas are neither influenced by others nor owned individually. Instead, they arise directly from the experience of Nihilism itself, akin to Plato’s Theory of Recollection, where knowledge is recollected from a timeless realm. This understanding also kindles an interest in exploring the existence or lack thereof of the Infinite or Transcendent.
-  _Interconnection & Driven Exploration_: Through philosophical contemplation, the Nihiltheist discerns parallels in the narratives of religions, mystics, and psychedelic experiences, reflecting symbolic similarities. This recognition fuels an experimental quest, engaging with diverse practices, seeking access to the reported Transcendent realm.

## 2\. The Uncanny Illusion of Naturalism

### The Nightmare of Self-Aware Existence:

- **_Nihilism and its implications_ :** The text extensively explores the concept of Nihilism, its profound impact on human existence, and how it challenges traditional values and beliefs.
- _Continuous Struggle & Transcendent Similarity_: The dual nature of human existence introduces tension between the worldly and the Transcendent. The journey becomes a perpetual oscillation, driven by the curiosity to explore and the pull of worldly concerns. Portrayed as a state of being torn between the finite and the Infinite, the natural and the Transcendent, as fundamental to the human condition.
- **_Critique of optimism and worldly pursuits_ :** The text criticizes superficial optimism and the pursuit of worldly pleasures, suggesting that these are distractions from confronting the true nature of existence.
- **_The absurdity of existence_ :** The text emphasizes the Absurd, the conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the inability to find any.
- **_The role of science and religion_ :** Both science and traditional religious interpretations are critiqued for their limitations in addressing the human condition. Science is criticized for its focus on the 'How?' rather than the 'Why?', while religion is criticized for providing pre-packaged 'answers' that limit exploration of existential mysteries.
- **_The concept of guilt_ :** The text explores the existential concept of guilt, suggesting it stems from the dual nature, or 'always falling' condition, which is the inability to recognize one's True-Self, resolving in unending frustration of the natural man.
- **_The rejection of worldly meaning_ :** The text suggests that worldly meaning is illusory and that true understanding comes from recognizing and confronting Nihilism.
- **_The importance of philosophical inquiry_ :** The text underscores the importance of philosophy as a means of exploring the mystery of being, as opposed to closing it off with assumptions and pre-determined answers. Philosophy breeds skepticism, not knowledge.

## 3\. Madness, Nonexistence, and the Other

- _The exploration of existentialism, nihilism, and the human condition_ : The document delves into the philosophical concepts of nihilism and existentialism, and their implications on the human condition. The quotes from various philosophers and authors serve to illustrate these concepts and their impact on human understanding and existence.
- _The relationship between nihilism, madness, and suicide_ : The document raises important questions about the links between nihilism, madness, and suicide. It explores whether the full apprehension of man's condition (nihilism) could lead to madness and if suicide is a necessary consequence of nihilism.
- _The concept of 'authentic' suicide_ : The document introduces the idea of an 'authentic' suicide, one that is not a response to worldly distractions but a release into the divine. It questions whether suicide is the 'optimal' set of movements for a nihilist.
- _The exploration of the logic of life and the logic of suicide_ : The document discusses the dichotomy between the logic of life and the logic of suicide. It suggests that one will always speak past the other as they are based on different understandings of the world and existence.
- _\*\*The idea of solitude and introspection_ \*\*: The document emphasizes the role of solitude and introspection in understanding the human condition and the nature of existence. It suggests that solitude allows one the space for philosophical contemplation of the Nothingness, which in turn diminishes the finite, keeping the Infinite as priority, and pointing to a higher order of reality.
- _**The exploration of the concept of 'faith'**_  : The document delves into the concept of 'faith' in relation to Nothingness, suggesting that 'faith' is the experience of something 'beyond' the Nothingness of the world.
- _\*\*The questioning of the value of a worldly life_\*\*: The document questions the value of a worldly life and suggests that the experience of Nothingness is more authentic and meaningful.
- _\*\*The exploration of the idea of 'God-intoxicated men'_ \*\*: The document explores the idea of 'God-intoxicated men', individuals who are so consumed by their love for God that they become mad or inebriated. It questions whether this form of madness is a form of divine revelation or simply a symptom of human insanity.

## 4\. The Startling Nothingness of the Transcendent Other

Me- Think about changing "Worldly" to either "egoistic", "temporal", or "ascetic". I think "Temporal" may be a good choice, due to its contrasting nature with "Infinite".

- _Temporal and Transcendent Forms of Nihilism_: The text distinguishes between the Augmented and diminished forms of Nihilism and explores the connection between them.
- _Clearing the Path in Nihiltheism_: The concept of "Nihiltheism" involves a clearing of the path between the Worldly experience of Nihilism and the Transcendent experience of Nihilism.
- _Significance of Infinite Nothingness_: The importance of the sense of the ‘Infinite’ as a Nothingness that is everything is elaborated upon.
- _Continuous Struggle & Transcendent Similarity_: The dual nature of human existence introduces tension between the worldly and the Transcendent. The journey becomes a perpetual oscillation, driven by the curiosity to explore and the pull of worldly concerns. The experience of Nihilism, being the teacher, shapes the unfolding realization of Transcendent similarity.
- _Familiarity in Transcendent Experience_: A sense of familiarity, remembrance, or “at-homeness” in the Transcendent experience is examined, connecting to deep psychological roots and memories. This alludes to Plato's Theory of Recollection, where one has always been with the Eternal Forms prior to inhabiting a phyiscal existence, and we are to therefore try to remember what we already know.
- _Origins of the Conception of ‘Hell’_: The text touches on the origins of the conception of ‘Hell’ and the necessity of humility and submission in mystical experience.
- _Multifaceted Perspectives on Nihilism and Transcendence_: Various quotations from philosophers, mystics, and theologians are woven into the text to provide multifaceted perspectives on Nihilism, Transcendence, and mystical experiences.
- _Naturalism vs. Transcendence in Nihilism_: The relationship between Naturalism, Nihilism, and Transcendence is probed, questioning whether Nihilism can be reduced to naturalism.
- _Transcendent as Part of the Subconscious Mind_: The idea of Transcendent as part of the subconscious mind is explored, along with its implications for the understanding of self and consciousness.
- _Discussion on the Possibility of Empirical Data_: The possibility of empirical data, in the form of scientific research (neuroscience, brainscans, use of Ai, etc.) supporting the existence of both a Naturalistic and a Transcendent component to the Nihilistic experience.
- _Nihilism as Mystical Experience_: The Nihilistic experience is described as part mystical, and there is an exploration of how Nihilism, in its other temporal form, opens up the Transcendent.
- _Psychedelic Experiences and Confrontation with the Other_: Psychedelic experiences are presented as a means to achieve not only the revealing of a wholly unimaginable incorporeal realm of existence, but further, an encounter with something Other, an 'Infinite Presence', leading to a disruption of one's worldview. The encounter with what is perceived as an 'Infinite Presence' is simultaneously a meeting with a separate, distinct Other and a complete oneness or union with.
- _Transcendent as Part of the Subconscious Mind_: The idea of Transcendent as part of the subconscious mind is explored, along with its implications for the understanding of self and consciousness.
- _Exploration of the Use of Psychedelics_: psychedelic experiences as a means to confront the Transcendent, which include the precautionary aspects, related to their use, of embracing humility, contemplative philosophical study, set/setting, and a deliberate intent for the journey.
- _Renunciation, Humility, and Dissolution of the Ego_: The text emphasizes the importance of renunciation, humility, and the dissolution of the ego for a true encounter with the Transcendent.
- _Music as a Tool for the Journey with the Other_: Music, specifically Bach's organ music, is suggested as a tool to assist in the journey with the Other, given its abstract nature and ability to guide one through the experience.
- _The Illusory Nature of the 'Real' World_: The idea that the 'real' or 'only' world may be an illusion, and the Other world is experienced as more real, is explored.
- _The Role of Emptiness in Buddhism_: The concept of Emptiness in Buddhism is touched upon, describing it as an Absolute Emptiness transcending all forms of mutual relationship.
- _Psychological Disorientation and Longing_: the psychological disorientation and longing associated with returning, or being 'dropped back into the world', from the Transcendent experiences into the irresolvable doubt of the Nothingness.

## 5\. The Symbolic Echo of Nothing

- _Exploration of the Transcendent within Nihilism_: Questions the relationship between Nihilism and Transcendence, and the possibility of an authentic encounter with the Other.
- _Role of Language in Nihilism_: Examines the inefficiency of language and the suggestion of a language dedicated to Nihilism for navigating perceived meaninglessness.
- _Non-Transferability of Nihilistic Experience_: Considers the challenge of expressing Nihilism and the non-transferability of the experience itself.
- **\_Facing Existential Terror without Rescue**: Emphasizes the need for a language of Nihilism that brings one face-to-face with existence without rescuing from Nothingness.
- _Faith, Religion, and Human Condition_: Criticizes religious interpretations for their assumptions and failure to open up the mystery of existence.
- _Scientific and Religious Perspectives_: Critiques both scientific realism and traditional religious perspectives for their limitations in engaging with the existential mystery.
- _Optimism and American Culture_: Analyzes the fallacy of optimism, particularly in American culture, and its contrast to the reality of Nihilism.
- _Heidegger's Concepts as Foundations for Nihilism_: Utilizes Heidegger's concepts of anxiety, everydayness, authenticity, and others as possible foundations for a Nihilistic language.
- _Being-Towards-Death in Heidegger's Thought_: Briefly summarizes Heidegger's concept of 'Being-Towards-Death' as an example of the foundation for a Nihilistic language.
- _Introduction of 'Nihiltheism'_:\_ Proposes the term 'Nihiltheism' to ground human experience within the context of Nihilism, transcending myth and empirical facts.
- _Further Reflection on Nihilistic Language_: Calls for further development or acknowledges the inevitable failure of a language of Nihilism that can capture the Transcendent.

_**Possible Categories to Write On- Could this language help others who can’t seem to figure out what this ‘yearning’ or ‘hole in the middle of myself’ is?  And is there some moral obligation or duty to produce such a language if it would be of benefit to others?  It seems not.**_
